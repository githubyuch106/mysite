  <h2>About Yuchen</h2>
  <p>It all started in an beautiful automn's morning of 1989. I was born to a bankers family, so the first word I said is "bull-ish", according to my father. I swam for my middle school and high school. Of course, I generously gave my medals to all my competitors. 
  <br><br>I graduated in college with my bacholer degree in Mathematics ready to change the world. Lucky enough, I was chosen to participate in the Walt Disney's Internship program in Orlando. Based on Disney, the program was extremely competitive that year and each one of us was chosen in less than a 2&#37 acceptance rate (that is less than Harvard admission acceptance rate). I leanrt a lot from Disney. I worked within a team, led a team also worked independently to create innovation skills to better assist the company. 
  <br><br class="disney"><img src="images/thumb_IMG_8934_1024.jpg" alt="" width="152" height="204" align = "right"/>Post Disney time, I joined Bank of China to work as the buisness system consultant. There, I developed my business background and communication skills. My responsibilities including interview clients to set up requirements and business boundaries. I was the bridge between clients, IT vendors and other stakeholders. Occasionally, I analyze data for stakeholders by using excel and other statistical softwares. At the same time, it always in the back of my mind to further develope my academic background. 
  <br><br>I joined Archmere Academy at the end of 2014. I taught all computer science classes including <i>AP Computer Science A in Java</i> and <i>Game Design in Python</i>. I also taught <i>Honors Physics</i>. The second year at Archmere, I taught <i>Chemistry</i> instead; of course, to the top of all computer science classes.   
  
  <br><br>
  Besides work, I enjoy so golf, running and hiking. I love the national parks and I also love traveling.</p>
